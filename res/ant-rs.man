.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ant-rs
(Another Network Tunnel) is a simple program for local/remote port forwarding over a SSH tunnel.
This program supports remote and local port forwarding to a ssh server.
When run in daemon mode the program will try to reconnect to the server if connection is lost.
Through the \fBant-rs-daemon.service\fR systemd service can the program be run on boot (uses \fI/etc/ssh/ant.yaml\fR as configuration file).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c, \-\-config\fR \fIconfig_file\fR
Path to \fBant-rs\fR YAML configuration file \fIconfig_file\fR.
User, who executes \fBant-rs\fR has to have read access on configuration file, otherwise all systemwide paths are allowed.

By default, \fI~/.ssh/ant.yaml\fR.
The systemd \fBant-rs-daemon.service\fR uses by default \fI/etc/ssh/ant.yaml\fR as its configuration file.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-daemon
Run application in daemon mode.
This option will recreate the child \fBssh\fR process, when its predecessor exited (e.g. due to connection timeout).
This procedure will ensure that \fBant-rs\fR will not exit on connection loss, but rather try to reconnect to the server, till Ctrl-C is pressed.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Prints help.

.TP
\fB\-l, \-\-log\-level\fR \fIlog_level\fR
